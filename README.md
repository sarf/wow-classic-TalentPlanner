What is this?
-------------

This is an addon for WoW Classic, that allows you to plan out your talent build.

One of the main goals is to prevent you from putting a talent point in the heat of the moment (or combat); the Talent Planner forces you to press its "Apply" button for each talent you want to learn (though you may queue up an entire build, if you so desire).


How do I keep it up to date?
----------------------------

Either download the zip-files in the release part, or use this nifty trick to clone the git repository directly into your Addons directory:

```git clone https://github.com/sarf/wow-classic-TalentPlanner.git <your WoW Classic addons Directory>/TalentPlanner```



Contact info

Contact me using the name erispose at wowinterface.com for feedback. When I feel the addon is stable enough, I will publish it there, and maybe elsewhere.
